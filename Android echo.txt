## Understanding Android Studio EcoSystem

## Android EcoSystem

Android ecosystem this translates to inter-dependence between users, developers, and equipment makers. 

One man’s trash is another man’s treasure”. The high price tag on Apple products makes a new market for cheaper Android phones and hence the scope of ‘Android Ecosystem’. Most students in India use Android devices and hence they need to find out a way and use all their devices together.

## How to use Android Ecosystem

Most laptops we use are Windows, hence it is not the finest pair with an Android phone.There are a lot of 3rd party apps that will help you get the most of your present devices. One example of such a web app is Snap drop. I personally like this app a lot as it not only works with all your devices irrespective of platform, but it also works in situations where you have done a cross-platform data transfer. So now, you can take a screenshot of your timetable from the LPU Touch app and transfer the same to your laptop without any cables. There are a lot more apps that could change your life for good if you are a student. One such app is Your Phone app which creates a wireless bridge between your windows laptop and your android phone, which, apart from texting from your laptop, offers the feature to even make phone calls directly from your laptop.
